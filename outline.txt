Pairs Trading Outline

-Start with 2D
-Export x+y signals, midpoint prices at time increments
-Investigate optimal entry/exit with the signal
1) Simple linear regression, set above threshold for transaction costs
2) Find empirical probability distribution, calculate expected value (nope)
3) machine learning classification methods for entry/exit
	-1 if expected value of distribution is > transaction cost
	-or perhaps just another naive linear thing

-Extend into multidimensional, 8D
-Do all the same things




Perhaps investigate regime changes?

"Developed/backtested multi-dimensional "pairs" trading strategy
on eurodollar futures with CME tick data. Created initial signal via projections+PCA
and investigated applications of machine learning for optimal entry/exit.
